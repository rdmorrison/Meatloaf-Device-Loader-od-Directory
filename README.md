# Meatloaf-Device-Loader-od-Directory
This repository powers the Meatloaf device—a multi-device emulator for the Commodore 64/128—by serving dynamically generated .prg files over HTTP. It uses PHP to construct tokenized BASIC programs compatible with C64 memory layout and Meatloaf's loading conventions.
